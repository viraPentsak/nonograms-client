##Puzzle legend structure


###Legend numbers are representing the filled cells go row after row in the following directions:

- For horizontal legend above the puzzle: bottom --> top.   
  NB!  In data array for horizontal legend on the first level are cols, and second - rows
- For vertical legend to left of the puzzle: right --> left

Thus backend returns data according to these rules.

###But the puzzle itself (solution map) goes from left to right, from top to the bottom
